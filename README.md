A cassandra object mapper using gocql under the hood.


#### Wow, cool, how does it work?

#### Anything else?

For those who wonder - this project will be a merge of hailocab/om and hailocab/erdos.
Using the API of erdos with the CQL backend of om.

API is not final! Please hate as much as possible, it will probably hurt my feelings a lot but at least we will have a usable library.
